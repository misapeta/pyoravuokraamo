# pyoravuokraamo

Note: This project is based on "Web-technologies" Fitech-course @University of Vaasa. Special thanks to Lecturer Maarit Välisuo for teaching and for the base code, I've made changes to my needs for this practice.

## Project "Pyörävuokraamo"'s idea

This is a web-app, where you can have a database (SQLite, unfortunately)  for bikes not only with appropriate information but servicehistory as well.

New people can join that app by filling a form, clicking "Asiakkaat"-button. Information of customers is available only for authorized bikerental personnel.

Note 2: This is a practice, do not use this in a real production case!
